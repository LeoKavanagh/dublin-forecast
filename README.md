# Dublin Forecast

Is this a microservice?

(I am aware that this is not a microservice.)

Scrape tomorrow's weather forecast for the Dublin area from Met Ã‰ireann's website.

Send it to a different AWS Lambda endpoint. In my case. I have one set up that
will text something to me via a Telegram bot.
